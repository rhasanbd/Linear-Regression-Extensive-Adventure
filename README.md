# Linear Regression - OLS 


There are two very different solution approaches for the Linear Regression problem.

- The “closed-form” solution approach known as the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.
- Iterative optimization approach known as Gradient Descent (GD).
    

We will perform an extensive investigation of these two approaches using **Scikit-Learn** in a series of four notebooks. For this exploration we will use the Boston Housing dataset that has 506 samples and 13 features.

There are four notebooks on sklearn Linear Regression.

1. Linear Regression-1-OLS
        -- OLS method & Regularized OLS Method (Ridge Rergression)
2. Linear Regression-2-OLS Polynomial Regression-Frequentist Approach (MLE)
        -- Polynomial regression using the OLS method
3. Linear Regression-3-OLS Polynomial Regression-Bayesian Approach (MAP)
        -- Polynomial regression using the regularized OLS method
4. Linear Regression-4-Gradient Descent
        -- Iterative optimization approach (Gradient Descent & Stochastic Gradient Descent)
