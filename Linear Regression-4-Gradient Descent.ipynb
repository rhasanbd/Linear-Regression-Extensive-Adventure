    "# Linear Regression - Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we investigate an iterative optimization method known as gradient descent (GD) to solve the Linear Regression problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red size=3> **Application Scenario:**</font> \n",
    "The GD approach is suitable for the following scenario.\n",
    "- Dataset: can be very large (unable to fit into computer's memory)\n",
    "- No. of Features: Large\n",
    "- Relationship between input (features) and output (target): Linear & Nonlinear (Polynomial Regression)\n",
    "- Out-of-core support: Out-of-core algorithms can handle vast quantities of data that cannot fit in a computer’s main memory. An out-of-core learning algorithm chops the data into mini-batches and uses online learning techniques to learn from these mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "We perform the following tasks.\n",
    "- Task 1: Implement GD on a Linear Regression Model\n",
    "- Task 2: Implement GD on a Polynomial Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that the Polynomial Regression model has more power to discover the nonlinear pattern in the dataset. However, it suffers from the overfitting problem (high-variance and less generalizable). By implementing a regularized Polynomial Regression model using GD, we can obtain a better generalizable solution. Note that we obtained a similar optimal solution in notebook 3 using the OLS regularized Polynomial Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Descent\n",
    "The gradient descent-based methods are used when there are a large number of features or too many training instances to fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three variants of the Gradient Descent Algorithm.\n",
    "- Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "- Mini-batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides only the Stochastic Gradient Descent model. In this notebook, we will see how to use sklearn's SGDRegressor.\n",
    "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "Batch Gradient Descent uses the whole batch of training data at every step. As a result, it is slow on very large training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with Batch Gradient Descent is the fact that it uses the whole training set to compute the gradients at every step, which makes it very slow when the training set is large. At the opposite extreme, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) just picks a random instance in the training set at every step and computes the gradients based only on that single instance. Obviously this makes the algorithm much faster since it has very little data to manipulate at every iteration. It also makes it possible to train on huge training sets, since only one instance needs to be in memory at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, due to its stochastic (i.e., random) nature, this algorithm is much less regular than Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of gently decreasing until it reaches the minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on average. Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will continue to bounce around, never settling down. So once the algorithm stops, the final parameter values are good, but not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to consider the following two issues when using the gradient descent algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Learning Rate\n",
    "If the learning rate is set to a too-low value, the algorithm will eventually reach the solution. But it will take a long time. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too high, the algorithm diverges, jumping all over the place and actually getting further and further away from the solution at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a good learning rate, we can use a grid search. However, we may want to limit the number of iterations so that grid search can eliminate models that take too long to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No. of Iterations\n",
    "Setting the number of iterations is tricky. If it is too low, we will still be far away from the optimal solution when the algorithm stops. But if it is too high, we will waste time while the model parameters do not change anymore. A simple solution is to set a very large number of iterations but to interrupt the algorithm when the gradient vector becomes small. That is when its norm becomes smaller than a tiny number $\\epsilon$ (called the tolerance). This happens when Gradient Descent has (almost) reached the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Boston housing dataset that provides housing values in the suburbs of Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "URL: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston\n",

    "\n",
    "The **MEDV** variable is the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data description\n",
